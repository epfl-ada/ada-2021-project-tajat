Save this as X.json.gz to drive.\n","*   Load the X.json.gz and filter it again based on our 12 chosen newspapers. Add the newspapers to a column. Save as X-filtered.json.gz.\n","\n","\n","The reason for not having these two steps as one is to be able to change things, e.g. change or add more newspapers without having to re-load from quotebank. \n","\n","Drawbacks and TODO!\n","\n","*   Only loading the 'uk' domains potentially miss UK-quotes. E.g. the count for BBC quotes seem suspiciously low. We are missing the bbc.com/news/uk for example (.co.uk seems to be used when in UK, .com/news/uk when outside? Both are present in the dataset). \n","*   At the moment none of the 'speaker = None' quotes are used. When focusing on topics of quotes, this might still contain interesting information.\n","*   It is possible to load one year into one dataframe, but each yearly-dataframe become very large. Will look into another approach. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rkIRsXxNVJCU"},"source":["import bz2\n","import json\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","!pip install tld\n","from tld import get_tld"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CEcIlRwfWY4C","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636736948243,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1453,"user":{"displayName":"Johanna Frost","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"00660902172880982863"}},"outputId":"de9b173a-6f54-4b4c-e3d1-812f84c4073c"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5HIghhmvR0vM"},"source":["PATH_TO_DATA = '/content/drive/MyDrive/ADAMilestone2/Data/'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"T7M8nBfBS_yz"},"source":["Filter the total data set with a UK domain and None speakers.
